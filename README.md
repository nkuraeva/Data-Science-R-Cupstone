During the work on the project, the provided data with samples from news, tweets and blogs in English were taken. At the first stage, various models for predicting the next word were built and their accuracy and required resource costs were assessed. As a result, the Back off Model from the sbo library was chosen for further development.
At the second stage, an assessment of the optimal ratio of resource consumption - efficiency was carried out (as a result, 10% of the provided data was selected). Next, the application was built ('https://kuraeva.shinyapps.io/NextWordPredictorV/') and a presentation ('https://rpubs.com/NKuraeva/817862') was created.
